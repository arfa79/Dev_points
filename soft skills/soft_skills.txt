============ Feedback ============

we should tell about our feelings to our teamates to change
or continue their behavior (coaching)
============ outsiding the feelings ==========
sometimes people around ous should see what we are thinking 
and feeling about the important matters

============ unwanted behaviours ===============

all of the people in the diffrent situations have some behaviours
may them not notice to that but when their monitor them selves 
they will understood thats an issue and if they want to solve that 
thats the problem. so we should get help from an experinced coach 
or a professional to fix that cause when we get older thats not easy to fix somthing we have done for decades
